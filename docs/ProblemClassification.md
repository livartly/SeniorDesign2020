# Types of problems

## 1.1 Statements, Symbolic Representations and Tautologies
---
### Truth Table Builder
User will input a well-formed formula (wff) and optionally, to show intermediates (verbose on/off). The output will be a truth table that has a row for each combination of the individual arguments. The output will also indicate if the wff provided is a tautology (last column is always true) or a contradiction (last column is never true).  

## 1.2 Propositional Logic
---
###

## 3.1 Recursive Definitions
---
### Recursive Sequence Builder
User will input one or more base cases, a recurrence relation, and the number of additional elements expected (n). The Recursive Sequence Builder will validate the input will yield tractable results and then output the next n number of elements in the recurrence relation.

## 4.1 Sets
---
### Subset Determination
User will define and provide all elements for two or more sets. Sets may be strings or numbers. The output will display all cases where a set is a proper subset of another set.

### Powerset
User will provide all elements of a set. The engine will check if the powerset will have a reasonable size. If so, the output will be the powerset of the provided set.

### Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Subtraction, Cartesian Product)
User will define and provide all elements of two separate sets. User will also pick one of the 4 supported operations of sets. The output will be the result of the set operation.

## 5.1 Relations
---
### Multiplicity Classifier
User will provide a relation (which can be viewed as list of ordered pairs). The program will classify the provided relation as either one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.

### Closure (Reflexive, Transitive, Symmetric, Anti-Symmetric)
User will provide a set and a relation. The engine will verify the relation is bound by the provided set and then classify the relation for closure on each of the supported properties (reflexive, transitive, symmetric, anti-symmetric).

### Equivalence Class
